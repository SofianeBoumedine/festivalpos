# FestivalPOS
FestivalPOS is a POS system tailored for small festivals, serving customers in bars, foodshops, etc.
It is designed to be easy to use for non-technical volunteer staff, while supporting many of the features required by small festivals:

* Super fast and friction free transaction flow
* Allow for muliple points of sale with individual statistics
* Buy using predefined customer credit accounts, creditcard using SumUp (not working yet), and cash payments.
* Easily message organizing staff in case of technical issue or supply outages.
